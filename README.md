Disclaimer:  We didn't finish on time.  It's about 75% complete.  You can still get a good idea though by looking at it.

So, what is it?

Basically gps coordinate and data mapping for dummies.  You make an excel file, upload it, move the sliders to the columns, to select the longitude, latitude, and data column, and then it displays your data at the gps coordinates, with larger values represented as larger dots.

Complete:  file upload, convert excel to json and display excel in browser.  
Incomplete:  dynamic excel columns, sliders to select columns.  d3 visualisation needs to switch to using the json returned by the upload instead of test data.

I'll finish it up sometime soon.  But it's 5:37am and I have to be at work in 3 hours.
